The following table shows a list of IAM Policies that are currently used in the account. This report shows [Customer-Managed Policies](#customer-managed-policy), [Inline Policies](#inline-policy), and [AWS-Managed Policies](#aws-managed-policy).

If the policy contains IAM Actions - or combinations of actions - that fall under certain risk categories - [Privilege Escalation](#privilege-escalation "Privilege Escalation"), [Resource Exposure](#resource-exposure "Resource Exposure"), [Infrastructure Modification](#infrastructure-modification "Infrastructure Modification"), and [Data Exfiltration](#data-exfiltration "Data Exfiltration") - then the number of occurrences per-policy and per-risk is included in the table. **If there are no findings for a particular policy, or if the policy is not attached to any IAM Principals, then the policy is not included in the findings.**

If an IAM Role leverages the given policy and is leveraged [by a Compute Service](#roles-assumable-by-compute-services) - like EC2 Instance Profiles for `ec2`, `ecs-tasks`, `lambda`, or `eks` - then that is indicated in the table as well.

Each of the aforementioned attributes can be used to prioritize which risks to address first. For more information, see the [Prioritization Guidance](#remediation-prioritization) and [Triaging Considerations](#triage-triaging-considerations). Consider using all of the Guidance criteria when reviewing this report as well.

Note that policies or IAM Principals excluded from the scan will not show up in the table at all. Please refer to the [Exclusions configuration](#exclusions) to see which ones were excluded. To view the list of IAM Principals and their associated policies, see the [IAM Principals Tab](#nav-principals).
